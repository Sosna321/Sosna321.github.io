        I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at Howard University with a passion for
        applying quantitative and computational methods to address public health challenges in
        under-resourced communities. My research focuses on developing mathematical and statistical
        models for infectious diseases—with a particular emphasis on HIV drug resistance dynamics.
        I am committed to leveraging advanced modeling and machine learning techniques to promote
        health equity and improve patient outcomes globally.

        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="section-body">
            My academic interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, epidemiology, and public
            health. I am particularly driven by the potential of mathematical modeling to illuminate
            disease dynamics, guide clinical decision-making, and support public health interventions.
            Beyond my research, I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to address disparities
            in healthcare access and outcomes.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body">
            At Howard University, I am actively involved in research projects that combine differential
            equations, numerical analysis, and statistical modeling to explore the complex mechanisms
            that drive infectious disease spread. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development
            of predictive models and decision-support tools that can improve health systems in
            underserved regions around the world.
